### Description:
In response to needs identified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s Pacific Islands Regional Office (NOAA PIRO), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that explores the effects of both deposited and suspended sediment on corals to identify stressor thresholds. We identified levels of sediment exposure (i.e., concentration and duration) that cause adverse physical, physiological, behavioral, developmental, and ecological responses in coral.

#### Project:
* **coral_stressor_thresholds.Rproj:** Project in R that contains data and analyses in the 'sediment' subfolder:
  
#### Data and Analyses:  
Within the 'sediment' sub-folder of the main project, there are two subfolders:  
  
* **sediment/binary analyses/:** The contents of this folder are multiple R markdown (.Rmd) files that have the details of the BINARY meta-analyses for each of the coral responses. The HTML files of the same name show the results (statistical modeling and figures) of each of these analyses, for ease of interpretation outside of the R environment. The associated binary dataset is in the 'data' subfolder.
  
* **sediment/dose-response analyses/:** The contents of this folder are multiple R markdown (.Rmd) files that have the details of the quantitative, DOSE-RESPONSE meta-analyses for each of the coral responses. The HTML files of the same name show the results (statistical modeling and figures) of each of these analyses, for ease of interpretation outside of the R environment. The associated dataset with effect sizes is in the 'data' subfolder.
