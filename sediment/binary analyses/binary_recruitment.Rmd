#### Here I will explore how DEPOSITED AND SUSPENDED sediment affects the RECRUITMENT of tropical, scleractinean coral JUVENILES. The database to be used is comprised of data extracted from studies deemed relevant during the systematic literature review process.

# The Dataset
  
## Deposited Sediment 
Specifically, we will explore the results of 132 datapoints from 3 studies conducted in 1 ocean on 4 species within 2 genera.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#head(recruitment)
recruitDS <- binary %>%
  filter(DS_SS=="DS") %>% 
  filter(Binary_sed_burial=="0") %>% 
  mutate(Gsp = paste(Updated_Genus, Updated_species, sep = "_")) %>% 
  select(Ref, Ref_name, Control_code, Sed_level_stand_mg, Binary_recruit_death, Updated_Genus, Gsp, Ocean, Sed_exposure_days, Surface_direction, Coral_age_at_start_expt_days_since_settled) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Binary_recruit_death)) %>% 
  filter(Surface_direction=="top")
recruitDS %>% tally() #n=132 datapoints, tally() returns same result as count(recruitDS)
recruitDS %>% count(Ref, sort=T) #n=3 studies
recruitDS %>% count(Ref_name, sort=T) #n=3 studies, count(Ref_name) = group_by(Ref_name) %>% tally()
recruitDS %>% count(Ocean, sort=T) #n=1 ocean
recruitDS %>% count(Gsp, sort=T) #n=4 species
recruitDS %>% count(Updated_Genus, sort=T) #n=2 genera
```
  
## Suspended Sediment 
Specifically, we will explore the results of 16 datapoints from 2 studies conducted in 1 ocean on 4 species within 3 genera.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#head(recruitSS)
recruitSS <- binary %>%
  filter(DS_SS=="SS") %>% 
  mutate(Gsp = paste(Updated_Genus, Updated_species, sep = "_")) %>% 
  select(Ref, Ref_name, Control_code, Sed_level_stand_mg, Binary_recruit_death, Updated_Genus, Gsp, Ocean, Sed_exposure_days, Coral_age_at_start_expt_days_since_settled) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Binary_recruit_death))
recruitSS %>% tally() #n=16 datapoints, tally() returns same result as count(recruitSS)
recruitSS %>% count(Ref, sort=T) #n=2 studies
recruitSS %>% count(Ref_name, sort=T) #n=2 studies, count(Ref_name) = group_by(Ref_name) %>% tally()

# Exploratory plots

First let's explore all data from all species for which there is binary data about the presence of 'recruit mortality' as a result of exposure to deposited sediment.  

##### DEFINITIONS:  
* '**Recruit mortality**' is the death of a juvenile coral, after it has settled to the reef surface, but before it has reached adult size/reproductive status.

# Threshold Analyses with Binary Data 
Now let's calculate thresholds based on the binary data explored above.  

##### DEFINITIONS:  
* '**LOAEL**', or the 'lowest observed adverse effect level' is defined as the lowest dose at which there was an observed adverse effect.  
* '**NOAEL**', or the 'no observed adverse effect level' is defined as the highest dose at which there was NOT an observed adverse effect.  
* '**Adverse effect**' is defined here as any response of a coral individual, colony, or experimental treatment group that *may* negatively affect the coralâ€™s fitness and/or survival. These adverse effects may include sublethal physiological changes (e.g., significantly reduced growth or photosynthetic rates when compared to coral in ambient/control conditions), bleaching/tissue loss, and mortality.  This definition of adverse effect is independent of its magnitude, so while the affect may have potentially reduced fitness, its magnitude may be sufficiently small that the fitness effect is not measureable.

#predicted probabilities, converted to 0 or 1 respectively:
p <- as.numeric(predict(modDS1b, type="response")>0.5)
#proportion correct:

auc(roc(recruitDS2$Binary_recruit_death, pred_modDS1b)) #AUC: 0.9275
#can also check out 'performance' package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/performance/performance.pdf
r.squaredGLMM(modDS1b) #The fixed effect of sediment level explains ~0.3% of variation of the total variation. If the random intercepts for studies are also included, then 55.8% of variation is explained.

#https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/8318/interpretation-of-log-transformed-predictors-in-logistic-regression
#Generally, each k-fold increase in x is associated with a change in the odds by a multiplicative factor of k^(Beta). For instance, k=2 for a doubling of x and k=0.5 for a halving of x is associated with a change in the odds of success by a factor of k^(Beta).
#If predictor is log-transformed:
#"Case 1: k=e, i.e. natural log transformed independent variable. Then if Beta is close to zero we can say "a 1% increase in x leads to a Beta percent increase in the odds of the outcome.""
#"Case 2: base k transformed independent variable: Then the exponentiated coefficient, exp(Beta), can be interpreted as the proportionate increase in the odds from a k-fold increase in the independent variable." -- For k=10, exp(Beta) is the multiplicative change in the odds of success with a 10-fold increase in X1 (with X2 fixed, if relevant).

#Model was non-significant, but suggestive
se <- sqrt(diag(vcov(modDS1b)))
tab <- cbind(Est = coef(modDS1b), 
             LL = coef(modDS1b) - 1.96 * se, 
             UL = coef(modDS1b) + 1.96 * se)
2^(tab)
```
    
There is suggestive, but non-significant, evidence to suggest that for every doubling of exposure concentration of deposited sediment, the odds of recruit mortality increase by 1.06 times (95% CI 1.00, 1.12; GLMM z = 1.859, p = 0.063) after accounting for the age of the sediment-exposed coral.

Let's see if I can plot the average marginal probability, i.e., the average change in probability of the outcome across the range of the predictor of interest. This is described in some detail at the following, useful website: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/mixed-effects-logistic-regression/

#https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/8318/interpretation-of-log-transformed-predictors-in-logistic-regression
#Generally, each k-fold increase in x is associated with a change in the odds by a multiplicative factor of k^(Beta). For instance, k=2 for a doubling of x and k=0.5 for a halving of x is associated with a change in the odds of success by a factor of k^(Beta).
#If predictor is log-transformed:
#"Case 1: k=e, i.e. natural log transformed independent variable. Then if Beta is close to zero we can say "a 1% increase in x leads to a Beta percent increase in the odds of the outcome.""
#"Case 2: base k transformed independent variable: Then the exponentiated coefficient, exp(Beta), can be interpreted as the proportionate increase in the odds from a k-fold increase in the independent variable." -- For k=10, exp(Beta) is the multiplicative change in the odds of success with a 10-fold increase in X1 (with X2 fixed, if relevant).

#Not significant
#se <- sqrt(diag(vcov(modSS1)))
#tab <- cbind(Est = fixef(modSS1), 
#             LL = fixef(modSS1) - 1.96 * se, 
#             UL = fixef(modSS1) + 1.96 * se)
#2^(tab)
```
    
There is no significant relationship between exposure concentration of suspended sediment and the odds of recruit mortality (GLMM z = 0.003, p = 0.998).
