These datasets contain information from multiple articles (**Ref_name**) and studies/experiments (**Ref**) within those articles about the effects of DEPOSITED sediment on the **recruit survival rate** of juvenile corals. I would like to explore the dose-response relationship between sediment 'dose' and the effect size, estimated here as the standardized mean difference between treatment and control, in terms of Hedges' *d*:

- Hedges' *d* is the standardized mean difference between the treatment and control groups (Hedges and Olkin 1985). Each study may have multiple Hedges' *d* calculations, one for each treatment-control comparison at each time-point.   

- 'Dose' can be quantified as sediment exposure concentration (mg/cm^2^/day), exposure duration (days), or as "cumulative exposure", for which I multiply concentration and duration (mg/cm^2^).

Each study/experiment (Ref) may contain multiple sets of controls and treatments (due to using multiple species or sediment types, for instance). Thus, I have added two categorical vectors, '**Comparison**' and 'Control', which group each set of control-treatment comparisons into a unique two-letter code, within which is one control (Control=="1") and at least one treatment (Control=="0"). **Therefore, 'Comparison' is nested within 'Ref', which is further nested within 'Ref_name'.**

### 1. Plots  
I calculated the standardized mean difference in terms of Hedges' *d* and plot it here with respect to exposure concentration. I did this first for a Hedges' *d* that I calculated before importing the data to R and again for a Hedges' *d* that is calculated by the dosresmeta::covar.smd function.

It is interesting that there is a difference between how I calculated Hedges' *d* and how *dosresmeta* appears to calculate it. But in both cases, there does not appear to be an effect of sediment exposure on effect size, except for *Acropora hyacinthus*, for which there appears to be a strong effect of sediment on effect size. There is not a discernible effect of geography (ocean and region) because almost all of the data were from the Marianas Islands. I still need to investigate the effects of sediment type (source, origin, grain size).
  
### 2. Model Fitting 
The following set of functions model fixed and random (nested) effects WITHOUT accounting for within-comparison (or within-study) correlations. The output for each is a univariate, random-effects meta-regression.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#?mixmeta

# Organizational Note: 
#All models have exposure concentration as its predictor. 
#All models with 'd' at the end of its name have covar.smd calculated Hedges' d as its response.

# LINEAR FIXED AND RANDOM EFFECTS NOT ACCOUNTING FOR WITHIN-STUDY CORRELATIONS
mod_DS_recruit_1d <- mixmeta(smd ~ Sed_level_standardized, S = vmd,
                      random =  ~ Sed_level_standardized | Comparison,
                      data = ES_DS_recruit2, method = "ml")

# LINEAR FIXED AND RANDOM, NESTED EFFECTS NOT ACCOUNTING FOR WITHIN-STUDY CORRELATIONS
mod_DS_recruit_2d <- mixmeta(smd ~ Sed_level_standardized, S = vmd,
                      random =  ~ Sed_level_standardized | Ref/Comparison,
                      data = ES_DS_recruit2, method = "ml")
```

To account for within-comparison correlations in the mixmeta model, I replace the 'S' argument with a 'control' argument, which requires me to provide the covariance matrices, as done with the covar.smd function. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# COMPUTE THE WITHIN-COMPARISON CORRELATIONS 
# already done above but code repeated here...
#covar_DS_recruit <- by(ES_DS_recruit, ES_DS_recruit$Comparison, function(x) 
#  covar.smd(Tx_mean, Tx_sd, Tx_n, "smd", method="hedges", data = x))


# LINEAR FIXED AND RANDOM EFFECTS ACCOUNTING FOR WITHIN-COMPARISON CORRELATIONS
#Code for covariance matrix to include for addSlist for Comparison random effect
newlist_REC <- list(NA)
for (i in seq(1,length(covar_DS_recruit))) {
newlist_REC[i] <- list(covar_DS_recruit[[i]]$S)
}
mod_DS_recruit_5d <- mixmeta(smd ~ Sed_level_standardized,
                       random = ~ Sed_level_standardized | Comparison,
                       data=ES_DS_recruit2, method="ml", #using dataset without controls
                       control=list(addSlist=newlist_REC))


# LINEAR FIXED AND RANDOM, NESTED EFFECTS ACCOUNTING FOR WITHIN-COMPARISON & WITHIN-STUDY CORRELATIONS
#Code for covariance matrix to include for addSlist for Ref/Comparison
newlist_REC2 <- list(NA) #collects the list of covariance matrices for the block diag matrix by reference for the nested hierarchial ref/comparison
templist_REC <- list(NA) #holds temp list of covariance matrices associated with each reference
templist_REC2 <-list(NA)
reflista <- ES_DS_recruit %>% distinct(Ref,Ref_name,Comparison)
reflist <- reflista[,1]
for (i in seq(1,length(unique(reflista$Ref))))  {
  #pull the elements from covar_DS_recruit that are all from the same reference [i]
  templist_REC[i] <-list(covar_DS_recruit[reflist==unique(reflista$Ref)[i]])
  for (j in seq(1,length(templist_REC[[i]]))) {
  #for each comparison in the reference, pull out the covar matrices (element $S) and put in into templist_REC2
     templist_REC2[j] <- list(templist_REC[[i]][[j]]$S)
  }
  #turn list of covars from all comparison in one reference into block diag matrix
  newlist_REC2[i] <- list(bdiagMat(templist_REC2))
  templist_REC2 <- list(NA)
}
mod_DS_recruit_6d <- mixmeta(smd ~ Sed_level_standardized,
                       random = ~ Sed_level_standardized | Ref/Comparison,
                       data=ES_DS_recruit2, method="ml", #using dataset without controls
                       control=list(addSlist=newlist_REC2))
```
  
And now to compare relative fit of linear models...

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Model Comparisons
AIC(mod_DS_recruit_1d, mod_DS_recruit_2d, mod_DS_recruit_5d, mod_DS_recruit_6d) 
#of these, model 5d has lowest AIC
```
  
And now to evaluate residuals of models...

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Residuals vs. Fitted Plots and Normal Q-Q Plots
op <- par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar = c(2,2,4,1))

resid_d <- resid(mod_DS_recruit_5d)
fitted_d <- fitted(mod_DS_recruit_5d)
plot(fitted_d, resid_d, main = "D: smd ~ mg_cm2_d, control = addSlist,
     random =  ~ mg_cm2_d | Comparison")
abline(0,0)

qqnorm(resid_d)
qqline(resid_d)

par(op)
```
  
Patterns:
1.  Residuals are very similar, with reasonable magnitudes (<abs(3)), but a lot of "clumping" along fitted values axis bc they're all from same exposure concentration in single study.
2.  No obvious need to try out log or non-linear models!
  
### 3. Best-Fit Model Summary
  
#### MG/CM2/DAY IS PREDICTOR, Model using dosresmeta calculation of Hedges' *d*
Now I will predict the effect size along the exposure range and plot with confidence intervals.  
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(mod_DS_recruit_5d)

# PREDICT THE EFFECT SIZE FOR 13.2 mg/cm2 FROM TWO MODELS (LOAEL identified by binary analyses)
#predict(mod_DS_recruit_5d, newdata=data.frame(Sed_level_standardized=13.2), ci=TRUE)

# PREDICT THE EFFECT SIZE AND PLOT WITH CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
pred_mod_DS_recruit_5d <- predict(mod_DS_recruit_5d, newdata=ES_DS_recruit2, ci=TRUE)
ES_DS_recruit2_CI4 <- cbind(ES_DS_recruit2, pred_mod_DS_recruit_5d)
#head(ES_DS_recruit2_CI4)
min_conc_d <- ES_DS_recruit2_CI4 %>% 
  mutate(overlap0 = 0 >= ci.lb & 0 <= ci.ub) %>% 
  filter(overlap0==FALSE) %>% 
  summarize(min_conc_d=min(Sed_level_standardized))
min_conc_d2 <- as.numeric(min_conc_d)

ggplot(ES_DS_recruit2_CI4, 
       aes(x = Sed_level_standardized,
           y = smd,
           color = Ref,
           ymin = smd-vmd,
           ymax = smd+vmd)) + 
  geom_pointrange() +
  labs(x = expression("Sediment exposure concentration (mg/cm"^"2"*"/day)"),
       y = expression("Effect size (Hedges'"~italic(d)~"+/- variance of"~italic(d)~")"),
       color = "Study") +
  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope=0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=min_conc_d2, linetype="dashed", color = "red") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = Sed_level_standardized, y = smd,
                  ymin = ci.lb, ymax = ci.ub), 
              fill = "grey70", alpha = .15, 
              show.legend=FALSE, inherit.aes=FALSE) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Sed_level_standardized, y = fit), inherit.aes=FALSE) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,40), breaks=c(0,10,20,30,40,min_conc_d2), 
                label=c("0","10","20","30","40",round(min_conc_d2,digits=1)))
```
  
For every 1-unit increase in exposure concentration of deposited sediment, the Hedges' d effect size for coral recruit survival rate declined by 0.02 (95% CI -0.04, 0.00; DRMA z = -2.2410, p = 0.025), after accounting for variability by comparison (Fig. X, Table X). However, the best-fit model’s I2 statistic was 47.1%, indicating some residual heterogeneity unaccounted for by the model (Table X), which could be the result of taxonomic, geographic, and/or mineralogical differences among (and within) studies.
